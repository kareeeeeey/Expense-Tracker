# üí∏ Expense Tracker (React + Vite)

Welcome to the **Expense Tracker App** ‚Äî a simple, interactive web application that helps you keep track of your expenses. Built with **React** and **Vite**, this project lets users add, search, sort, and delete expense entries while providing a clean and responsive user interface.

---

## üß† Why I Built This

I created this project to:
- Practice **React fundamentals** like components and hooks
- Learn how to **manage state** and **pass props** between components
- Understand **form handling**, **conditional rendering**, and **list filtering**
- Improve **UI/UX** with a clean, modern interface
-

## üß© Project Structure & Explanation


### üîç `ExpenseForm.jsx`

- Contains a form with two input fields:
  - One for description (`<input type="text" />`)
  - One for amount (`<input type="number" />`)
- Uses `useState` to manage form data
- On submit:
  - Uses `e.preventDefault()` to avoid page refresh
  - Sends new expense data up to `App.jsx` using a callback (`onAddExpense`)

### üßæ `ExpenseTable.jsx`

- Displays expenses in a table format
- Receives:
  - A list of expenses via props
  - A delete function to remove individual expenses
- Maps through expenses and renders each row with:
  - Description, amount, and a delete button

### üîé `SearchBar.jsx`

- A simple input that captures the user‚Äôs query
- Uses an `onChange` event to lift the search text to `App.jsx`
- Filters the expense list in real-time as user types

### ‚öôÔ∏è `App.jsx`

- **Main state manager** for:
  - The full list of expenses (`useState`)
  - Search query
  - Sorting order (ascending/descending)
- Handles:
  - Adding new expenses
  - Deleting expenses
  - Filtering and sorting
- Passes props to child components
